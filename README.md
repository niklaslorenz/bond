# Bond

Bond is an agent framework for your terminal. It provides different entry points to interact with an agent and can be configured to fit your needs.

Customization includes:

- [Personas](#personas)
- [Providers](#providers)
- [Toolsets](#toolsets)
- [Skills](#skills)

## Personas

Personas are at the heart of bond. They describe the behaviour of the agent and what it can
and cannot do. For every persona, you can define:

- Which provider/model to use
- The system prompt
- The tools available to the agent
- The summarization behaviour

## Providers

Providers are what gives you access to language models. You configure them with your access
credentials so bond can work with its models.

Currently supported providers are:

- [Mistral](./docs/providers/mistral.md)
- [Ollama](./docs/providers/ollama.md)
